                p My background is rooted in biotechnology, with a particular focus on harnessing the 		  power of synthetic biology for therapeutic applications. Over the years, I've had 		  the privilege of contributing to the development of cutting-edge therapeutic 			  platforms for several pioneering cell therapy startups, where I witnessed firsthand 		  the transformative potential of synthetic biology to improve human health. What 		  truly excites me is the convergence of biotechnology and artificial intelligence,  		  as I see immense potential in AI to tackle complex challenges in healthcare, from 		  drug discovery to personalized medicine. This intersection of my professional 		  accomplishments and interests has driven me to explore opportunities where I can 		  continue to bridge the gap between biology and AI, ultimately making a positive 		  impact on the future of healthcare.
